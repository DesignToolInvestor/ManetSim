#MANET Simulation Tools

This is the GitHub in project names *ManetSim* at

https://github.com/DesignToolInvestor/ManetSim.git

##Purpose
This repository contains Python code for simulating MANET (Mobil Ad-Hoc Networks).
Many of the functions will be slow and need to be replaced by compiled equivalent
functions writen in compiled languages.  Nevertheless, it is easier to visualize 
in Python than in many performance oriented development environments.  It is 
anticipated that this library will be used for first draft algorithm development, 
that in order to scale compute intensive bottlenecks will be replaced by compiled
code (with Python wrappers), and that it will be used for scripting workflows.
